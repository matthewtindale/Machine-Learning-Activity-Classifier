# Machine-Learning-Activity-Classifier
A Python-based machine learning system that classifies human activity from accelerometer data with 89% accuracy, featuring end-to-end preprocessing, model training, and real-time classification through a Tkinter GUI.
main.py produces the hdf5 file with processed raw accelerometer data
train_logistic.py uses the hdf5 file and produces the model.pkl and scaler.pkl files used in app.py
